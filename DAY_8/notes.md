`Topic ` : Vectors in C++ (Array part 2)

`What are Vectors?`

- Vector is the next data structure.
- This data structure is very similar to Array.
- Also it have index as in array.
- *The main difference b/w array and vector is that it is dynamic in nature means it have not fixed size , there size can be change.*

`STL(Std. Template Library)` of C++ - A Toolbox that contain large no of data structure implementation code. for eg. stack , hashing etc..
 - we use this tools to solve quetions easily ,  not to start from the scratch . 
 - Some of these tools are : - vector
                             - queue
                             - stack 
                             - set
            - These are called as STL Containers

`1st STL CONTAINERS`

# Vector
    - Vector have dynamic features.
    - There size can be dynamically increase .
`Vector Syntax`
    vector<int>vec;

    vector<int>vec = {1,2,4}

    vector<int>vec(4,6) --> 4 size ka array banega or sbme value 6 hoga

- `Empty Vector` Eg: initialize.cpp --> vector<int>vec(5,0)

`Vector Functions : `

- Size : it measure the size of vectors
- push_back : it add the number in the last of the list
- pop_back : it delete the last number from the list.
- front - it print the first number 
- back - it print the back number
- at - it print the number at the specific index.


 `2 stage : `
    1. compile - check for sytaxital error.
    2. run


# `Static vs Dynamic `  Allocation

- Static : it allocated at compile time .
         - it get allocated at stack .

- Dynamic : it allocated at run time .
           - vector have dynamic memory
           - it get allocated in heap.  



# Most Important point (for bitwise operator)
--> n^n = 0
--> n^0 = n

# SUMMARY
    --> STL
    --> Vector
    --> vector fn
    --> static & dynamic 
    --> vector in memory
    --> leetcode question
                |-> single number(bitwise operator)
    
# HOMEWORK
    1. Linear Search
    2. reverse code fn.
