`Topic `:  Bitwise Operators, Data Type Modifiers & more(MISCELLANEOUS CONCEPTS)

# MISCELLANEOUS CONCEPTS 

`Bitwise Operators`
- Bitwise &(AND)
- Bitwise |(OR)
- Bitwise ^(XOR) 
            if bits are same ---> 0(ans)||
            if bits are diff ---> 1(ans )
- Bitwise <<(left shift)
- Bitwise >>(right shift)

# Operator Precendence
    |           Operators       |Precedence (when associativity equals )    |
    =========================================================================
    |!,+,-(unary operators)     | first (R to L)          |
    |*,/,%                      | Second(L to R)          |
    |+,-                        | Third (L to R)          |

    | &&                        | sixth (L to R)          |
    | ||                        | Seventh (L to R)        |
    | = (assignment operator)   | last (R to L)           |
    =======================================================

# Scope
    |-> two types of scope : 
           |--> Local eg : if-else, loops , function , block of code etc.
           |--> Global eg:  if we implement the value before main fn it will be globally access.
        
    
# Data Type Modifiers
--> Change meaning of data types 

        |Data Types     | Size      |
        ==============================
        |   long        | 4 byte    |
        |   short       | 2 byte    |
        |   long long   | 8 byte    |
        |   signed      | 4 byte    |
        |   unsigned    | 4 byte    |
        ==============================

# SUMMARY  

        - bitwise operator
