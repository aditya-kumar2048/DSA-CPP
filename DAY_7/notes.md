# All Power is Within YOU ; YOU can do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING

# GOAL :  To Master Data Structure and Algorithm using C++

`Day - 7` (04/08/25)

-----
`Topic` : Arrays

---

*Arrays* ---> 1st Data Structure that we are going to study

    Data Structures ---->  store Data 
  =======
    |--> Linear ( that can be imagined as a single line )
    |--> Hierarchial (that form hierarchi)


    Algorithms - The efficient operation performs on data are known as algorithm.
            eg. sorting data , searching data , etc,..

    
*Arrays* : - Same data type 
           - Contiguous in memory
           - linear 
           - array index start from 0
           - first position = 0 index
           - last position = (size - 1)index


 # Pass by reference
 ---
- In C++ a reference is an alternative name for an object or function , and its address is the address of the object or function it refers to . For sak of understanding we are calling it address here .

# SUMMARY
    Array ------> create
          ------> index fundamentals
          ------> input / output concept
          ------> Loops ---> min & max concept
          ------> Linear Search
          ------> Reverse of array

# HOMEWORK

      A. WAF to calculate sum & product of all no in an array
      B. WAF to swap the max & min numbere of an array.
      C. WAF to print all the unique values in an array.
      D. WAF to print intersection of 2 arrays.
