Topic : CONDITIONAL STATEMENT AND LOOPS

# Conditional Statements 
 
    a. if-else
    b. if-else if-else // Ladder if-else
    c. Ternary Statement

# Loops
    a. While Loop
    b. For Loop 
    c. Do-while Loop
    d. Nested loop - loop inside loop

# *Allways try to use cammelCase*

# Break - *it get exit from the loop directly OR it close the loop at certain condition*
